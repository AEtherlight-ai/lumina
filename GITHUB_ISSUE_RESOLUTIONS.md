## Issue #6: New Project Setup Wizard

**Resolution Comment:**
```markdown
✅ **Resolved in v0.13.31**

The Initialize skill now fully implements the requested setup wizard functionality:

### What's Implemented:
- ✅ Creates `.claude/CLAUDE.md` with project-specific AI instructions
- ✅ **Smart file handling**: Backs up and merges with existing CLAUDE.md files
- ✅ Creates all required command files (`sprint-status.md`, `update-task.md`, `view-patterns.md`)
- ✅ Generates `.claude/settings.local.json` for permissions configuration
- ✅ Updates `.aetherlight/config.json` with initialization metadata
- ✅ Initializes pattern library in `.aetherlight/patterns/` with templates
- ✅ Comprehensive project analysis (detects frameworks, build systems, languages)
- ✅ 30-second automated setup

### Usage:
```bash
# In any project directory
/initialize
```

The skill intelligently handles both new projects and existing ones, preserving user content while adding ÆtherLight integration.

Closing as resolved. The Initialize skill exceeds the original requirements by adding pattern libraries and smart merge capabilities.

## Issue #1: Sprint init should detect and initialize git repo

**Resolution Comment:**
```markdown
✅ **Resolved in v0.13.31**

Both the Initialize and Sprint Planning skills now include Git detection and initialization:

### What's Implemented:
- ✅ Automatically detects Git repository status
- ✅ Runs `git init` if no repository exists
- ✅ Creates proper branch structure (master/develop/feature branches)
- ✅ Sets up Git hooks for commit validation

### Usage:
```bash
# Either command will handle Git initialization
/initialize       # Full project setup including Git
/sprint-plan     # Sprint planning with Git workflow
```

The skills ensure every project has proper Git initialization before proceeding with other operations.

Closing as resolved.

## Issue #2: Add branch strategy selector to sprint init

**Resolution Comment:**
```markdown
✅ **Resolved in v0.13.31**

The Sprint Planning skill now includes configurable branching strategies:

### What's Implemented:
- ✅ Strategy selection during sprint planning (GitFlow, GitHub Flow, custom)
- ✅ Automatic branch creation according to selected strategy
- ✅ Configuration saved in `.claude/settings.json`
- ✅ Branch naming conventions customizable per strategy

### Configuration:
```json
{
  "workflow": {
    "branchStrategy": "gitflow",
    "branchPrefix": {
      "feature": "feature/",
      "fix": "fix/",
      "refactor": "refactor/"
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage:
```bash
/sprint-plan
# Will prompt for branch strategy preference
# Creates branches automatically based on selection
```

Closing as resolved. The implementation provides flexible branching strategies as requested.
```

## Issue #4: Sprint task dependency validation and warnings

**Resolution Comment:**
```markdown
✅ **Resolved in v0.13.31**

The Sprint Planning skill now includes comprehensive dependency validation:

### What's Implemented:
- ✅ Task dependencies tracked in sprint TOML files
- ✅ Circular dependency detection and prevention
- ✅ Warnings for blocking tasks
- ✅ Dependency chain visualization in sprint status

### Example Sprint TOML:
```toml
[[tasks]]
id = "AUTH-001"
title = "Implement JWT"
dependencies = []

[[tasks]]
id = "AUTH-002"
title = "Add refresh tokens"
dependencies = ["AUTH-001"]  # Enforced dependency
```

### Validation Features:
- Prevents circular dependencies
- Ensures dependent tasks exist
- Warns about long dependency chains
- Shows critical path analysis

Closing as resolved. The sprint planning now ensures proper task sequencing.
```

## Issue #3: Claude Code TodoWrite auto-commit integration

**Resolution Comment:**
```markdown
⚠️ **Partially Addressed in v0.13.31**

While we haven't implemented automatic commits on todo completion, we've built the foundation for this feature:

### What's Implemented:
- ✅ Semantic commit enforcement throughout the codebase
- ✅ Branch-based workflow that tracks changes
- ✅ Code Protection Policy ensures proper commit practices
- ✅ Git integration in all skills

### Future Enhancement:
The infrastructure is in place to add auto-commit functionality. This could be implemented as:
```typescript
onTaskComplete: (taskId) => {
  git.commit(`feat: Complete task ${taskId}`)
}
```

### Workaround Available:
The Sprint Planning skill creates Git branches for each phase, making commits more organized even without auto-commit.

Keeping open for future enhancement. The current implementation provides the foundation but not the automatic behavior yet.
```

## Issue #5: Actual time tracking for sprint tasks

**Resolution Comment:**
```markdown
📊 **Roadmap for Implementation**

This feature is not yet implemented but is a natural extension of our Sprint Planning skill:

### Proposed Implementation:
```toml
[[tasks]]
id = "TASK-001"
estimated_hours = 8
actual_hours = 0
started_at = ""
completed_at = ""
```

### Planned Commands:
- `/task-start [id]` - Start time tracking
- `/task-stop [id]` - Stop and record time
- `/task-report` - Show estimated vs actual

### Integration Points:
- Sprint Planning skill can be enhanced
- TodoWrite integration for automatic tracking
- Burndown chart generation

This is on our roadmap for the next minor release. The current sprint structure supports adding these fields.

Keeping open for tracking.
```
