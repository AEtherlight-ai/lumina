## [Unreleased]

### Planned for Beta (November 2025)
- End-to-end integration testing (Rust â†” VS Code extension)
- NAPI bindings stabilization
- Cross-platform testing (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- Performance validation (<50ms pattern matching)
- Offline mode full implementation
- Pattern matching validation with real-world codebases

## [0.15.1] - 2025-10-31 - Critical Bug Fixes

### Fixed
- **Skill Detection from Natural Language**: Fixed critical bug where skill detection was bypassed by complexity check
  - Natural language like "initialize my project" now properly triggers `/initialize` skill
  - Moved skill detection to run BEFORE complexity assessment
  - All 4 skills (initialize, sprint-plan, code-analyze, publish) now work from natural language
  - File: `vscode-lumina/src/services/PromptEnhancer.ts:82-127`

- **Record Button Functionality**: Fixed record button calling non-existent command
  - Button now actually starts recording instead of showing error
  - Changed from `captureVoiceGlobal` to `openVoicePanel` command
  - Matches backtick hotkey behavior
  - File: `vscode-lumina/src/commands/voicePanel.ts:1061-1070`

### Technical Details
- Root cause: Early return in complexity check prevented skill detection code from running
- Impact: Core v0.15.0 feature (natural language â†’ skill detection) was completely broken
- Fix time: ~1 hour from audit to published release
- All packages published: aetherlight, aetherlight-analyzer, aetherlight-sdk, aetherlight-node

---

## [0.15.0] - 2025-10-31 - Autonomous Agent Features

### Added
- Skill-based command system for common workflows
- Natural language enhancement with skill detection
- PromptEnhancer service for intelligent prompt generation
- SkillDetector for automatic skill matching from user intent
- Four managed skills: initialize, sprint-plan, code-analyze, publish
- Audit documentation system for release validation

### Known Issues (Fixed in 0.15.1)
- Skill detection was non-functional due to flow control bug
- Record button didn't trigger recording
