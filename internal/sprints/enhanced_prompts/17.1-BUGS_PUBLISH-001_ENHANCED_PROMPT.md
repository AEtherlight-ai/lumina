## Step 0: Pre-Task Analysis (8 Steps - Answer OUT LOUD)

**CRITICAL: Complete this checklist BEFORE running publish script.**

### PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST

**Before Publishing to npm and GitHub:**

1. ✅ **Did I verify all dependencies are complete?**
   - If NO → Check Sprint TOML NOW
   - Required: DOC-001 (CHANGELOG updated), QA-001 (ripple analysis), QA-002 (integration tests)
   - Validation: All 3 tasks must be status="completed"

2. ✅ **Did I verify npm authentication?**
   - If NO → Run: `npm whoami`
   - Expected: `aelor` (MUST be logged in as aelor)
   - If not aelor → Run: `npm login` (Username: aelor)

3. ✅ **Did I verify Git workflow is correct?**
   - If NO → Check NOW:
   - Should be on `master` branch (after PR merge from feature/v0.17.2-bug-fixes)
   - Git status should be clean (no uncommitted changes)
   - Branch should be up-to-date with origin
   - If on feature branch → Create PR, merge to master, THEN publish

4. ✅ **Did I verify GitHub CLI authentication?**
   - If NO → Run: `gh auth status`
   - Expected: Logged in to github.com account
   - If not authenticated → Run: `gh auth login`

5. ✅ **Did I verify desktop app installers exist (if BUG-007 complete)?**
   - If NO → Check NOW: `dir vscode-lumina\Lumina*.exe vscode-lumina\Lumina*.msi`
   - Expected files:
     - `Lumina_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe` (~4.0MB)
     - `Lumina_0.1.0_x64_en-US.msi` (~5.8MB)
   - If missing → Script will warn but continue (desktop app won't be available for this release)

6. ✅ **Did I read the publish script and skill documentation?**
   - If NO → Read NOW:
     - `scripts/publish-release.js` (lines 1-150) - Automated release pipeline
     - `.claude/skills/publish/SKILL.md` (lines 1-150) - Publish skill workflow
   - Understand the 13-step automation sequence

**If you answered NO to ANY question, STOP and complete it NOW.**

## Task Overview

### What Needs to Be Done

Use the automated publish script (`node scripts/publish-release.js patch`) to release v0.17.2 to npm and GitHub with all bug fixes, authentication integration, and MVP-003 prompt enhancer.

### Why This Matters

**User Impact:**
- Users waiting for 14 bug fixes (BUG-001 through BUG-014)
- License validation improvements (BUG-002, BUG-011) require user upgrade
- Desktop app authentication integration (BUG-006) enables secure voice transcription
- ENHANCE-001 series (v3.0 AI Enhancement System) provides better prompt quality

**Technical Impact:**
- Automated script prevents version mismatch bugs (historical issues: v0.13.28, v0.13.29)
- GitHub release required for CLI installer (users install via `npm install -g aetherlight`)
- VS Code Marketplace update enables extension auto-update
- Desktop app installers bundled with GitHub release

### Success Criteria

After PUBLISH-001 complete:
- ✅ npm package published successfully (`aetherlight@0.17.2`)
- ✅ GitHub release created (v0.17.2 tag)
- ✅ VS Code Marketplace shows v0.17.2
- ✅ Users can install via VS Code Extensions UI
- ✅ Desktop app downloadable from releases page (if BUG-007 complete)
- ✅ All 4 packages version-synced (aetherlight, aetherlight-sdk, aetherlight-analyzer, aetherlight-node)
- ✅ Release notes published (from CHANGELOG.md v0.17.2 section)

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Pre-Publish Verification (10 minutes)

**1.1 Verify All Dependencies Complete**
```bash
# Check Sprint TOML for task status
grep -A 3 "tasks.DOC-001\|tasks.QA-001\|tasks.QA-002" internal/sprints/ACTIVE_SPRINT_17.1_BUGS.toml | grep status

# Expected output:
# status = "completed"  (all 3 tasks)
```

**Validation:**
- DOC-001 completed → CHANGELOG.md has v0.17.2 section
- QA-001 completed → Ripple analysis found no breaking changes
- QA-002 completed → Integration tests passed (100% pass rate)

**If ANY dependency incomplete → STOP and complete dependency first.**

**1.2 Verify Git Workflow**
```bash
# Check current branch
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
# Expected: master

# Check git status (should be clean)
git status
# Expected: "nothing to commit, working tree clean"

# Check if up-to-date with remote
git fetch origin
git status
# Expected: "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'"
```

**If on feature branch:**
1. Create PR: `gh pr create --title "Release v0.17.2 - Bug Fixes + MVP-003" --body "See CHANGELOG.md for details"`
2. Get PR reviewed and merged
3. Checkout master: `git checkout master`
4. Pull latest: `git pull origin master`
5. THEN continue with publish

**1.3 Verify npm and GitHub Authentication**
```bash
# Check npm login
npm whoami
# Expected: aelor
# If not: npm login (Username: aelor)

# Check GitHub CLI
gh auth status
# Expected: Logged in to github.com account
# If not: gh auth login
```

**1.4 Verify Desktop App Installers (Optional)**
```bash
# Check if installers exist
dir vscode-lumina\*.exe vscode-lumina\*.msi

# Expected (if BUG-007 complete):
# Lumina_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe  (~4.0MB)
# Lumina_0.1.0_x64_en-US.msi  (~5.8MB)

# If missing: Script will warn but continue
# Desktop app won't be available for this release
```

**Pre-Publish Checklist Complete:**
- ✅ Dependencies verified
- ✅ Git workflow correct
- ✅ Authentication verified
- ✅ Desktop installers checked

---

### Phase 2: Run Automated Publish Script (15 minutes)

**2.1 Execute Publish Script**
```bash
# Run automated release pipeline (patch bump: 0.17.1 → 0.17.2)
node scripts/publish-release.js patch

# If you want to auto-confirm all prompts:
node scripts/publish-release.js patch --yes
```

**2.2 Monitor Script Output (13-Step Sequence)**

The script will execute these steps automatically:

**Step 1: Verify npm authentication**
```
✓ Logged in as aelor
```

**Step 2: Verify Git workflow**
```
Current branch: master
✓ Working tree is clean
✓ Branch is up-to-date with origin
```

**Step 3: Check GitHub CLI authentication**
```
✓ GitHub CLI authenticated
```

**Step 4: Bump version across all packages**
```
✓ Bumping version from 0.17.1 to 0.17.2
✓ Updated vscode-lumina/package.json
✓ Updated packages/aetherlight-sdk/package.json
✓ Updated packages/aetherlight-analyzer/package.json
✓ Updated packages/aetherlight-node/package.json
```

**Step 5: Compile TypeScript**
```
▶ cd vscode-lumina && npm run compile
✓ TypeScript compilation successful
```

**Step 5.5: Build Desktop App (if applicable)**
```
▶ cd products/lumina-desktop && npm run tauri build
✓ Desktop app built successfully
✓ Installers found:
  - Lumina_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe (4.0MB)

```

**Step 6: Verify compiled artifacts exist**
```
✓ out/extension.js exists
✓ out/services exists
✓ All artifacts verified
```

**Step 7: Package VS Code extension**
```
▶ cd vscode-lumina && npm run package
✓ Created aetherlight-0.17.2.vsix
```

**Step 8: Verify package is valid**
```
✓ .vsix file exists: vscode-lumina/aetherlight-0.17.2.vsix
✓ File size: ~500KB (typical size)
```

**Step 9: Commit version bump**
```
▶ git add .
▶ git commit -m "chore: bump version to 0.17.2"
✓ Version bump committed
```

**Step 10: Create git tag**
```
▶ git tag v0.17.2
✓ Tag created: v0.17.2
```

**Step 11: Push to GitHub (FIRST - before npm publish)**
```
▶ git push origin master --tags
✓ Pushed to GitHub
✓ Tag v0.17.2 pushed
```

**Step 12: Create GitHub release with artifacts**
```
▶ gh release create v0.17.2 --notes-file .release-notes.tmp \
  "vscode-lumina/aetherlight-0.17.2.vsix" \
  "vscode-lumina/Lumina_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe" \
  "vscode-lumina/Lumina_0.1.0_x64_en-US.msi"

  - Lumina_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe (4.0MB)
  - Lumina_0.1.0_x64_en-US.msi (5.8MB)
```

**Step 13: Publish to npm (LAST - after GitHub release verified)**
```
▶ cd vscode-lumina && npm publish --access public
✓ Published aetherlight@0.17.2 to npm registry

✓ Verified packages published:
  - aetherlight@0.17.2
  - aetherlight-sdk@0.17.2

node scripts/publish-release.js patch
```

**4.8 Common Error: npm Publish Fails (Already Published)**
```
Error: ✗ npm ERR! 403 You cannot publish over the previously published versions
```

**This means version was already published. Options:**
1. **If publish was successful earlier:** Verify and skip npm publish step
2. **If publish was incomplete:** Bump to next patch version and retry

**Fix for incomplete publish:**
```bash
# Bump to next patch version
node scripts/bump-version.js patch
# Version: 0.17.2 → 0.17.3

# Update CHANGELOG with v0.17.3 (note: same changes as 0.17.2)
# Then retry publish
node scripts/publish-release.js patch --yes
```

---

## TDD Approach

**Pre-Publish Verification (Pattern-TDD-001):**

**Test 1: Verify Authentication**
```bash
# Test: npm whoami returns "aelor"
npm whoami | grep -q "aelor" && echo "PASS: npm authenticated" || echo "FAIL: npm not authenticated"

# Test: gh auth status succeeds
gh auth status > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "PASS: GitHub authenticated" || echo "FAIL: GitHub not authenticated"
```

**Test 2: Verify Git Workflow**
```bash
# Test: Current branch is master
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD | grep -q "master" && echo "PASS: On master" || echo "FAIL: Not on master"

# Test: Working tree is clean
git status --porcelain | wc -l | grep -q "^0$" && echo "PASS: Clean working tree" || echo "FAIL: Uncommitted changes"
```

**Test 3: Verify Build Artifacts**
```bash
# Test: TypeScript compiles without errors
cd vscode-lumina && npm run compile > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "PASS: TypeScript compiles" || echo "FAIL: Compilation errors"

# Test: .vsix package created
cd vscode-lumina && npm run package > /dev/null 2>&1 && [ -f "aetherlight-0.17.2.vsix" ] && echo "PASS: Package created" || echo "FAIL: Package not created"
```

**Test 4: Verify Published Versions**
```bash
# Test: All packages at v0.17.2
npm view aetherlight version | grep -q "0.17.2" && \
npm view aetherlight-sdk version | grep -q "0.17.2" && \
npm view aetherlight-analyzer version | grep -q "0.17.2" && \
npm view aetherlight-node version | grep -q "0.17.2" && \
echo "PASS: All packages version-synced" || echo "FAIL: Version mismatch"
```

**Test 5: Verify GitHub Release**
```bash
# Test: Release exists with all artifacts
gh release view v0.17.2 > /dev/null 2>&1 && \
gh release view v0.17.2 --json assets -q '.assets[].name' | grep -q "aetherlight-0.17.2.vsix" && \
echo "PASS: GitHub release complete" || echo "FAIL: Release missing"
```
