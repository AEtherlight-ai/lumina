- Manual test all features\r
- Lock down passing code (@protected, @immutable annotations)\r
- Build protection enforcement (pre-commit hooks)\r
- Fix failing features as bugs\r
- BLOCKS all other work until complete\r
\r
Phase 1: Build Sprint Template System\r
- Create SPRINT_TEMPLATE.toml (normalized tasks)\r
- Enhance sprint-plan skill with template injection\r
- Update validation/enforcement\r
- TEST by generating Phase 7 tasks for THIS sprint\r
\r
Phase 2-6: Self-Configuration System\r
- Platform vision: ÆtherLight adapts to ANY project\r
- Variable substitution, detection, interview, migration\r
- Enables community domain creation\r
- Ships software-dev domain initially\r
\r
Phase 7 (AUTO-GENERATED): Execute Normalization\r
- sprint-plan skill injects normalized tasks\r
- Validates template system works\r
- Completes sprint with quality assurance\r
\r
Constraints:\r
- Phase 0 BLOCKS Phase 1-6 (stable foundation required)\r
- Backward compatible (preserve user customizations)\r
- Performance (<5s init time, <200ms activation)\r
- TDD enforced (90% coverage for infrastructure)\r

With this: One-click export of complete task context in standard format.\r
"""
context = """
THE PROBLEM: Temporal Context Drift\r
Tasks written at sprint start (Day 1) become stale by execution time (Day 14+).\r
- Files change: New files created, existing files modified\r
- Tests added: Coverage increases, new test cases\r
- Dependencies shift: Completed tasks create new context\r
- Git commits: 15+ commits between task creation and execution\r
\r
Static TOML (Day 1) doesn't reflect reality (Day 14).\r
AI executing task with stale context → bugs, missed files, incorrect assumptions.\r
\r
SOLUTION: AI-Enhanced Prompts with Current State Analysis\r
When user requests task export, AI analyzes:\r
1. TOML baseline (original intent from Day 1)\r
2. Current project state (Day 14 reality):\r
   - Git diff since task written\r
   - Completed tasks (new context from finished work)\r
   - New/modified files\r
   - Test results\r
3. Enhanced prompt includes:\r
   - Original task intent\r
   - "Changes since task written" section\r
   - Updated file recommendations\r
   - Completed dependencies impact\r
\r
ARCHITECTURE: Terminal-Based Communication (Option D)\r
\r
**Scenario 1: Claude Code Already Running**\r
```\r

↓\r
Found active terminal ✅\r
↓\r
Extension: terminal.sendText("export prompt for PROTECT-001")\r
↓\r
I (Claude Code) receive command with FULL CONTEXT:\r
  - Read TOML baseline\r
  - Run git diff since task created\r
  - Scan for completed tasks\r
  - Check modified files\r
  - Generate AI-enhanced prompt\r
↓\r
I output enhanced prompt to terminal (markdown with end marker)\r

Extension: captureTerminalOutput() until "--- END PROMPT ---"\r

Extension: Display in TaskPromptViewer text area\r

**Scenario 2: Claude Code NOT Running**\r

Extension: Capture and display\r
```\r
\r
**Key: No IPC, No Webhooks, No Files**\r
- ✅ VS Code Terminal API (vscode.window.terminals)\r
- ✅ terminal.sendText() to send commands\r
- ✅ Terminal buffer capture for output\r
- ✅ Wait for initialization prompts\r
- ❌ NO file-based IPC\r
- ❌ NO WebSocket/HTTP\r
- ❌ NO temp files\r
\r
**AI Enhancement Logic (What I Do)**\r
When I receive "export prompt for PROTECT-001":\r
1. Read TOML from ACTIVE_SPRINT.toml\r
2. Extract task.created_date or estimate from git log\r
3. Run: git diff {created_date}..HEAD\r
4. Scan completed tasks: grep status = "completed"\r
5. Check files_to_modify: git status on each file\r
6. Run tests if mentioned: npm test\r
7. Generate enhanced prompt:\r
   - Original TOML sections\r
   - NEW: "Changes Since Task Written (14 days ago)"\r
   - NEW: "Completed Tasks Impact"\r
   - NEW: "Recommended File Updates"\r
   - NEW: "Current Test Status"\r

Gap:
- Enhancement buttons (Code Analyzer, Sprint Planner, Bug Report, Feature Request, General Enhance) use basic PromptEnhancer ✗

Solution:
Add generateEnhancedPromptFromTemplate(templateTask) method that:

Create internal/SPRINT_TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md with comprehensive documentation:\r
\r
1. Template System Overview:\r
   - What is the template system?\r
   - Why does it exist? (historical bugs, quality enforcement)\r
   - How does it work? (4-layer enforcement: injection, static, runtime, retrospective)\r
\r
2. Task Categories Explained:\r
   - REQUIRED tasks (13): Cannot skip, blocks sprint if missing\r
   - SUGGESTED tasks (4): Can skip with justification in [sprint.metadata]\r
   - CONDITIONAL tasks (8): Auto-included based on sprint type\r
     * Publishing tasks (5): If sprint name contains "release", "publish", "v\\d+\\.\\d+"\r
     * UX tasks (3): If user-facing changes detected\r
   - RETROSPECTIVE tasks (2): Every sprint learns from itself\r
\r
3. Using the Template:\r
   - Automatic injection via sprint-plan skill\r
   - Manual sprint creation (copy template tasks)\r
   - Skipping suggested tasks (add justification)\r
   - Customizing conditional detection logic\r
\r
4. Task Category Reference Table:\r
   | Category | Task IDs | Count | Requirement | Purpose |\r
   |----------|----------|-------|-------------|---------|\r
   | Documentation | DOC-001 to DOC-004 | 4 | REQUIRED | CHANGELOG, README, patterns, CLAUDE.md |\r
   | Code Quality | QA-001 to QA-004 | 4 | REQUIRED | Ripple, tests, deps, types |\r
   | Agent Sync | AGENT-001 to AGENT-002 | 2 | REQUIRED | Context updates, pitfalls |\r
   | Infrastructure | INFRA-001 to INFRA-002 | 2 | REQUIRED | Git hooks, validation |\r
   | Configuration | CONFIG-001 | 1 | REQUIRED | Settings schema |\r
   | Performance | PERF-001 | 1 | SUGGESTED | Regression testing |\r
   | Security | SEC-001 | 1 | SUGGESTED | Vulnerability scan |\r
   | Compatibility | COMPAT-001 to COMPAT-002 | 2 | SUGGESTED | Cross-platform, backwards |\r
   | Publishing | PUB-001 to PUB-005 | 5 | CONDITIONAL | Pre-publish checklist |\r
   | UX | UX-001 to UX-003 | 3 | CONDITIONAL | Upgrade docs, release notes |\r
   | Retrospective | RETRO-001 to RETRO-002 | 2 | REQUIRED | Sprint retro, pattern extraction |\r
\r
5. Customizing the Template:\r
   - Adding project-specific tasks\r
   - Modifying requirement levels (REQUIRED → SUGGESTED)\r
   - Updating conditional detection logic\r
   - Versioning template changes\r
\r
6. Template Version History:\r
   - v1.0.0 (2025-11-05): Initial template (27 tasks)\r
   - Future versions will be documented here\r
\r
7. Enforcement Mechanisms:\r
   - Layer 1: Auto-injection (sprint-plan skill) - TEMPLATE-002\r
   - Layer 2: Static validation (SprintSchemaValidator) - TEMPLATE-003\r
   - Layer 3: Runtime enforcement (WorkflowCheck) - TEMPLATE-004\r
   - Layer 4: Retrospective learning (RETRO tasks) - Every sprint\r
\r
8. Troubleshooting:\r
   - "Missing required task DOC-001" → Complete task or add to sprint\r
   - "SUGGESTED task SEC-001 skipped without justification" → Add to [sprint.metadata.skipped_tasks]\r
   - "Publishing sprint missing PUB-001" → Add publishing tasks or remove "release" from sprint name\r
\r
9. Update CLAUDE.md:\r
   - Add Pattern-SPRINT-TEMPLATE-001 to Design Patterns section\r
   - Update Sprint Planning Protocol (Pattern-SPRINT-PLAN-001) with template injection\r

   - Sprint Planner: sprint requirements (prompt user or use defaults)\r

   - Feature Request: form data (title, use case, solution, category)\r
   - Task buttons: TOML task fields (deliverables, context, why, validation_criteria, patterns, files_to_modify, reasoning_chain)\r

4. **Load enhanced prompt into main text area** ← CRITICAL STEP\r
