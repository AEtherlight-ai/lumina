Implement smart task starter button system to enforce TDD and workflow protocols.

**Problem:**
Currently, developers can bypass TDD, skip Pre-Task Analysis, and ignore sprint TOML updates.
No enforcement mechanism exists - workflow is optional, not mandatory.

**Solution: Option C - Smart Task Starter with Parallel Agent Support**

**Features:**

1. **"Start Next Task" Button (Primary)**
   - Finds next task with no blocking dependencies
   - Runs Pre-Task Analysis (8 steps) automatically
   - Generates test stubs (TDD RED phase)
   - Updates TOML status: pending → in_progress
   - Shows Code Workflow Check
   - Only then allows coding

2. **Individual Task "Start" Buttons**
   - Each task row has [Start] button
   - If dependencies not met → Show warning dialog
   - Suggest 3 alternative ready tasks
   - Allow override with warning

3. **Dependency Validation**
   - Check task.dependencies array
   - Verify all deps have status = "completed"
   - Block start if deps not met (with override)
   - Show clear dependency tree

4. **Smart Task Suggestions**
   - Find all tasks with status = "pending"
   - Filter to tasks with all deps completed
   - Sort by: no deps > short time > phase order
   - Return top 3 alternatives

5. **Parallel Agent Support**
   - Allow multiple tasks with status = "in_progress"
   - Track which agent/engineer owns each task
   - Warn on file conflicts between parallel tasks
   - Load balancing suggestions (UI vs Backend vs Tests)

**UI Components:**

Sprint Panel Header:
- [▶️ Start Next Task] button (primary CTA)
- "Next Ready: TASK-ID (name) | X hrs" label
- Progress: X/Y completed | Z in progress

Task Row:
- Status icon (⏸️ Pending, 🔒 Blocked, 🔄 In Progress, ✅ Completed)
- Task ID and name
- [▶️ Start] button (enabled if ready, 🔒 if blocked)

Dependency Warning Dialog:
- List blocking dependencies with status
- Show potential issues (integration failures, rework, test failures)
- Suggest 3 alternative ready tasks
- Buttons: [Start Alternative], [Show All Ready], [⚠️ Override], [Cancel]

**Algorithm:**

findNextReadyTask():
1. Filter tasks where status = "pending"
2. Check dependencies array for each
3. Verify all dependency task IDs have status = "completed"
4. Sort by: deps.length, estimated_time, phase
5. Return first match

findAlternativeTasks(blockedTask):
1. Find all pending tasks except blockedTask
2. Filter to tasks with all deps completed
3. Sort by estimated_time
4. Return top 3

startTask(taskId):
1. Validate dependencies (or show warning)
2. Run Pre-Task Analysis (8 steps)
3. Generate test file stubs
4. Update TOML: status = "in_progress"
5. Run Code Workflow Check
6. Enable Edit/Write tools

**Status Icons:**
- ⏸️ Pending (ready to start)
- 🔒 Blocked (deps not met)
- 🔄 In Progress (being worked on)
- ✅ Completed (done)
- ⏭️ Skipped (intentionally skipped)

**Phase 1 Complete:**
- ✅ TaskDependencyValidator service
- ✅ TaskStarter service
- ✅ Core algorithms (findNextReadyTask, findAlternativeTasks, startTask)
- ✅ TOML status update logic

**Phase 2 Goals (UI Integration):**

1. **Sprint Panel Header:**
   - Add "Start Next Task" button (primary CTA)
   - Show "Next Ready: TASK-ID (name) | X hrs" label
   - Display progress: "X/Y completed | Z in progress"

2. **Task Row Buttons:**
   - Add individual "Start" button to each task row
   - Button states: ▶️ (ready), 🔒 (blocked), 🔄 (in progress), ✅ (completed)
   - Click handler integrates with TaskStarter.startTask()

3. **Dependency Warning Dialog:**
   - Show when user clicks "Start" on blocked task
   - List blocking dependencies with status
   - Show 3 alternative ready tasks (from findAlternativeTasks())
   - Buttons: [Start Alternative], [Show All Ready], [⚠️ Override], [Cancel]

4. **Status Icon System:**
   - ⏸️ Pending (ready to start)
   - 🔒 Blocked (dependencies not met)
   - 🔄 In Progress (currently being worked on)
   - ✅ Completed (done)
   - ⏭️ Skipped (intentionally skipped)

5. **Message Handlers:**
   - startNextTask message → calls TaskStarter.findNextReadyTask()
   - startTask message → validates deps, shows dialog if blocked
   - override message → calls startTask(task, true)

6. **Pre-Task Analysis Display:**
   - Show 8-step analysis in ÆtherLight Output channel
   - Format as checklist with ✅/❌ status
   - Display confidence score and gaps

**UI Components to Add:**
- StartNextTaskButton (Sprint header)
- TaskStartButton (Task rows)
- DependencyWarningDialog (Modal/notification)
- StatusIconRenderer (Task status display)

**Integration Points:**
- voicePanel.ts (Sprint panel UI)
- TaskStarter.ts (Phase 1 services)
- SprintLoader.ts (Task data)
- ÆtherLight Output channel (Pre-Task Analysis logging)

**Implementation:**
- Remove margin-bottom from header

2. **Expands when button clicked** - Shows below text area
3. **One workflow at a time** - Clicking new button closes previous
4. **Toggle behavior** - Clicking same button again closes workflow
5. **Minimalistic** - No "Workflows" label or extra chrome

- Code Analyzer → Analyzer form
- Sprint Planner → Planner form
- Bug → Bug report form
- Feature → Feature request form
- Skills → Skills list
- Settings → Settings UI

  (Toolbar - single row)
  (Text Area)
  (Workflow Area - hidden or showing one workflow)

- Smooth expand/collapse animation (300ms)
- Consistent styling across all workflows
- Close button (X) in top-right corner
- Workflow title in header
- Content area for workflow-specific UI
- Action buttons at bottom (Enhance, Submit, Save, etc.)

- CSS for animations and styling

3. State management for active workflow
4. Message handlers for workflow switching
5. Content generators for each workflow type
6. Close workflow logic (X button or clicking same button)

2. Verify dropdown population code
3. Test with multiple sprint files in directory

5. Reload VS Code, verify selection persists

- Sprint files might not be scanned correctly
- Dropdown might only show ACTIVE_SPRINT.toml (hardcoded)

- Add file scanning logic to SprintLoader
