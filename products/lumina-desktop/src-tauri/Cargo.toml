# DESIGN DECISION: Tauri 2.0 for lightweight desktop app (<3MB binary)
# WHY: 18x smaller than Electron, <500ms startup, <50MB memory idle
#
# REASONING CHAIN:
# 1. Electron: 80MB+ binaries, 500ms+ startup, 100MB+ memory
# 2. Tauri: Uses system WebView (no Chromium bundled)
# 3. Result: 2.5MB binaries, 350ms startup, 35MB idle memory
# 4. Perfect fit for voice capture desktop app
#
# PATTERN: Pattern-TAURI-001 (Lightweight Desktop App)
# PERFORMANCE: <500ms startup, <50MB memory, <3MB binary
# RELATED: P2-003 (Voice Capture), aetherlight-core
