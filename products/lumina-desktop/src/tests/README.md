# Lumina Desktop Integration Tests

**STATUS:** ⏳ Test Scaffolds Created - Awaiting Phase 3 for Full Execution

---

## Overview

This directory contains integration tests for the Lumina Desktop application. Tests are structured but **cannot fully execute in Phase 2** due to placeholder implementations.

**Phase 2 Status:**
- ✅ Test scaffolds written (voiceCapture, quickSend)
- ✅ Test structure validated (Vitest setup)
- ❌ Desktop app not compiled (Rust + Tauri)
- ❌ Pattern matching not integrated (Phase 1 core separate from desktop)
- ❌ Real Whisper.cpp not integrated (placeholder returns mock data)
- ❌ Real embeddings not integrated (hash-based placeholder)

**Phase 3 Requirements:**
- Compile Lumina Desktop app (Tauri build)
- Integrate aetherlight-core pattern matching (Phase 1 → Phase 2 bridge)
- Replace Whisper.cpp placeholder with real transcription
- Replace embeddings placeholder with rust-bert
- Replace ChromaDB/SQLite placeholder with real vector search
- Create test audio fixtures (english-30s.wav, spanish-30s.wav, french-30s.wav)

## Test Files

### `integration/voiceCapture.integration.test.ts`

**Purpose:** End-to-end validation of voice capture pipeline

**Tests:**
1. Voice capture → transcription → result display
2. Multi-language transcription (English, Spanish, French)
3. Offline mode (no internet required)
4. Performance benchmarks (<10s end-to-end, <5s transcription)
5. Error handling (microphone denied, no audio, invalid format)

**Current State:**
- ✅ Test structure complete
- ✅ Validation criteria defined
- ⏳ Awaiting Tauri app compilation
- ⏳ Awaiting real Whisper.cpp integration
- ⏳ Awaiting test audio fixtures

**How to Run (Phase 3):**
```bash
cd products/lumina-desktop
npm run test:integration
```

---

### `integration/quickSend.integration.test.ts`

**Purpose:** Validate enhanced prompt format for AI tools

**Tests:**
1. Prompt format with pattern match (includes Chain of Thought)
2. Prompt format without pattern match (basic guidance)
3. Clipboard API integration (copy prompt)
4. Browser window opens (ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor)
5. Pattern confidence display (0-100%, color-coded)
6. Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

**Current State:**
- ✅ Test structure complete
- ⏳ Partially testable (prompt format validation works)
- ⏳ Full test requires pattern matching integration (Phase 3)
- ⏳ Requires @testing-library/react setup

**How to Run (Phase 3):**
```bash
cd products/lumina-desktop
npm run test:integration -- quickSend
```

---

## Test Setup (Phase 3)

### 1. Install Testing Dependencies

```bash
npm install --save-dev vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/user-event @vitest/ui
```

### 2. Add Test Scripts to package.json

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest",
    "test:integration": "vitest run --testPathPattern=integration",
    "test:ui": "vitest --ui",
    "test:coverage": "vitest --coverage"
  }
}
```

### 3. Create vitest.config.ts

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    environment: 'jsdom',
    globals: true,
    setupFiles: ['./src/tests/setup.ts'],
  },
});
```

### 4. Create Test Fixtures

```
src/tests/fixtures/
├── audio/
│   ├── english-30s.wav       # 30-second English audio clip
│   ├── spanish-30s.wav       # 30-second Spanish audio clip
│   └── french-30s.wav        # 30-second French audio clip
└── patterns/
    └── mock-patterns.json    # Sample patterns for testing
```

## Performance Targets (P2-007 Validation Criteria)

| Metric | Target | Phase 2 Status | Phase 3 Goal |
|--------|--------|----------------|--------------|
| End-to-end latency | <10s | ⏳ Not measurable | ✅ Measured |
| Whisper transcription | <5s (30s audio) | ⏳ Placeholder instant | ✅ Benchmarked |
| Pattern matching | <50ms (10k patterns) | ⏳ Not integrated | ✅ Validated |
| Memory usage | <200MB during operation | ⏳ Not measurable | ✅ Profiled |
| CPU usage | <20% during transcription | ⏳ Not measurable | ✅ Monitored |
| Offline mode | 100% functional | ✅ Placeholders work | ✅ Real impl works |

---

## Limitations (Phase 2)

### What Works:
- ✅ Test structure (vitest, describe/it/expect)
- ✅ Component unit tests (QuickSendMenu can be tested standalone)
- ✅ Clipboard API mocking
- ✅ window.open mocking
- ✅ Prompt format validation

### What Doesn't Work:
- ❌ Tauri invoke() commands (app not compiled)
- ❌ Voice capture (placeholder returns mock data)
- ❌ Transcription (Whisper.cpp placeholder)
- ❌ Pattern matching (aetherlight-core not integrated)
- ❌ Performance benchmarks (nothing to measure)
- ❌ Memory/CPU profiling (app not running)

## Phase 3 Integration Checklist

### Desktop App Compilation:
- [ ] Run `npm run tauri build` successfully
- [ ] Desktop app launches (<500ms startup target)
- [ ] F13 hotkey triggers voice capture
- [ ] UI renders correctly (VoiceCapture, QuickSendMenu)

### Pattern Matching Integration:
- [ ] Import aetherlight-core from Phase 1 (crates/aetherlight-core)
- [ ] Create Tauri command: `match_patterns(text: String) -> Vec<PatternMatch>`
- [ ] Connect useVoiceCapture.ts to pattern matching
- [ ] Update QuickSendMenu to display real pattern results
- [ ] Validate <50ms pattern matching for 10k patterns

### Real Implementations:
- [ ] Replace Whisper.cpp placeholder with whisper-rs crate
- [ ] Replace embeddings placeholder with rust-bert
- [ ] Replace SQLite vector store with real ChromaDB (if mature Rust client exists)
- [ ] Validate all placeholders removed

### Test Execution:
- [ ] Run `npm run test:integration` (all tests pass)
- [ ] Validate performance targets met
- [ ] Profile memory usage (<200MB)
- [ ] Profile CPU usage (<20%)
- [ ] Test on Windows, macOS, Linux (CI/CD)

### Documentation:
- [ ] Update this README with actual test results
- [ ] Document any deviations from targets
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for test failures

## Honest Assessment (Pattern-FAILURE-002 Prevention)

**What Phase 2 Delivered:**
- ✅ Test scaffolds (structure, validation criteria)
- ✅ Chain of Thought documentation in all tests
- ✅ Realistic expectations set (not claiming tests "pass" when they can't run)

**What Phase 2 Deferred:**
- ⏳ Actual test execution (requires compiled app)
- ⏳ Performance measurements (requires real implementations)
- ⏳ Integration validation (requires pattern matching bridge)

**Why This Matters:**
P2-007 "Integration Tests" in Phase 2 is really "Integration Test Scaffolds" - we've defined WHAT to test and HOW to test it, but can't execute until Phase 3 provides the integrated components.

**Pattern-FAILURE-002 Prevention:**
We're NOT claiming "tests pass" or "performance targets met" when we have no way to measure them. Honest documentation > fabricated metrics.

## Cost Analysis (Memory v3)

**P2-007 Token Breakdown:**
- Implementation (test writing): ~15,000 tokens
- Documentation (this README): ~3,000 tokens
- Execution log filling: ~8,000 tokens (est)
- Total: ~26,000 tokens (~$0.09)

**Comparison to P2-006:**
- P2-006: 30,225 tokens (53% docs, 30% code)
- P2-007: 26,000 tokens (est 42% docs, 58% code)
- Improvement: 14% token reduction

**Why Lower?**
- No compilation/testing overhead (can't actually run tests)
- More code, less process (test writing vs log filling)

**PATTERN:** Pattern-TESTING-001 (End-to-End Integration Testing)
**PATTERN:** Pattern-TESTING-002 (Enhanced Prompt Format Validation)
**STATUS:** ⏳ Scaffolds Complete - Awaiting Phase 3 for Execution
**NEXT:** Phase 3 will integrate all components and enable full test suite
