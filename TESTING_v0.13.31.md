# v0.13.31 Testing Checklist

## Pre-Release Testing Requirements

### 1. Voice Panel Fixes

#### Test: Global Buttons After Tab Switch
- [ ] Open Voice panel (backtick key)
- [ ] Click "Code Analyzer" button - verify it opens
- [ ] Switch to another tab (e.g., Terminal)
- [ ] Switch back to Voice tab
- [ ] Click "Code Analyzer" button again - **MUST WORK**
- [ ] Click "Sprint Planner" button - **MUST WORK**
- [ ] Verify no console errors

#### Test: Record Button
- [ ] Open Voice panel
- [ ] Click Record button
- [ ] Should NOT request microphone permission
- [ ] Should send backtick keystroke to trigger desktop app
- [ ] Verify status message shows "Triggering voice capture"

---

### 2. Skills Framework Testing

#### Test: Initialize Skill (Resolves Issue #6)

**Setup**: Create a test repository or use existing project

```bash
# Test 1: New project initialization
mkdir test-project && cd test-project
git init
# Run: /initialize
```

Verify created:
- [ ] `.claude/CLAUDE.md` with project instructions
- [ ] `.claude/settings.json` with workflow config
- [ ] `.claude/settings.local.json` with permissions
- [ ] `.claude/commands/sprint-status.md`
- [ ] `.claude/commands/update-task.md`
- [ ] `.claude/commands/view-patterns.md`
- [ ] `.aetherlight/config.json` with initialization metadata
- [ ] `.aetherlight/patterns/` with auth/database/api templates
- [ ] `sprints/SPRINT_INITIAL.toml`

**Test 2: Existing CLAUDE.md handling**
```bash
# Create existing CLAUDE.md
echo "# My Project" > CLAUDE.md
# Run: /initialize
```

Verify:
- [ ] Backup created: `CLAUDE.md.backup.[timestamp]`
- [ ] Existing content preserved in enhanced version
- [ ] √ÜtherLight features added without destroying user content

**This resolves Issue #6 completely** ‚úÖ

#### Test: Sprint Planning Skill (Resolves Issues #1, #2, #4)

```bash
# Run: /sprint-plan
```

Test Issue #1 - Git detection:
- [ ] If no Git repo, automatically runs `git init`
- [ ] Creates proper branch structure

Test Issue #2 - Branch strategy:
- [ ] Allows selection of branching strategy (GitFlow/GitHub Flow)
- [ ] Creates branches according to selected strategy
- [ ] Saves preference in `.claude/settings.json`

Test Issue #4 - Dependency validation:
- [ ] Creates sprint TOML with task dependencies
- [ ] Validates no circular dependencies
- [ ] Warns about blocking tasks

**This resolves Issues #1, #2, #4** ‚úÖ

#### Test: Code Analyzer Skill

```bash
# Run: /code-analyze
```

Verify:
- [ ] Performs comprehensive analysis
- [ ] Generates report in `analysis/ANALYSIS_[DATE].md`
- [ ] Identifies issues with severity levels
- [ ] Creates fix branches for critical issues
- [ ] Respects Code Protection Policy

---

### 3. Workflow Testing

#### Test: Git Workflow Enforcement

- [ ] Try to commit directly to master - should warn
- [ ] Create feature branch - should work
- [ ] Push feature branch - should work
- [ ] Create PR - should work with template

#### Test: Code Protection

- [ ] Identify a "protected" file (released code)
- [ ] Try to modify in feature branch - should warn
- [ ] Create refactor branch - should allow with restrictions
- [ ] Verify interface must remain unchanged

---

### 4. Publishing Workflow Test

#### Test: Publish Script Order
```bash
node scripts/publish-release.js patch --dry-run
```

Verify order:
1. [ ] Git workflow checks first
2. [ ] Build and compile
3. [ ] Push to GitHub FIRST
4. [ ] Publish to npm LAST
5. [ ] Create GitHub release with .vsix
