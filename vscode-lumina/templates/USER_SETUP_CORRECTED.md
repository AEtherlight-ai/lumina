# √ÜtherLight User Guide

**Welcome to √ÜtherLight!** This extension enhances your development workflow with sprint management and voice capture.

**CRITICAL:** This documentation MUST be read and followed by Claude Code. If Claude skips this or ignores enforcement rules, the system fails.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Install Desktop App (REQUIRED for Voice)

**Voice features require the √ÜtherLight desktop app running in the background.**

1. Download desktop app from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/F9-Global/Aetherlight_lumina/releases)
2. Install and launch (runs in system tray)
3. Desktop app provides:
   - Native microphone access
   - OpenAI Whisper integration
   - IPC server (ws://localhost:43215)

**Without desktop app:** Sprint Tab works, but voice features show error "Desktop app not connected"

### 2. Configure OpenAI API Key

Voice transcription requires OpenAI API key:

1. Open VS Code Settings (Ctrl+,)
2. Search for "aetherlight.openai.apiKey"
3. Enter your OpenAI API key
4. Key is synced to desktop app automatically

**Without API key:** Voice recording will prompt you to configure settings

### 3. Create Your First Sprint

File: `sprints/ACTIVE_SPRINT.toml`

**CRITICAL:** Each task MUST include a `prompt` field with full implementation context.

```toml
sprint_name = "My First Sprint"
start_date = "2025-10-25"
end_date = "2025-11-01"

[tasks.TASK-001]
id = "TASK-001"
name = "Setup √ÜtherLight in my project"
prompt = """
Verify √ÜtherLight is working correctly in this project.

Steps:
1. Open .vscode/aetherlight.md (this file)
2. Press backtick (`) to start voice recording
3. Verify Voice Panel opens and recording starts
4. Check Sprint Tab shows this task

Success criteria:
- Desktop app running in system tray
- OpenAI API key configured
- Voice recording works when backtick pressed
- Sprint Tab shows this task (TASK-001)
"""
status = "in_progress"
priority = "high"
estimated_hours = 0.5
dependencies = []
```

**Refresh Sprint Tab** ‚Üí Your task appears!

---

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts

### Working Hotkeys:

| Hotkey | Action | Requirements |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **\`** (backtick) | Start voice recording in Voice Panel | Desktop app + OpenAI API key |

**That's it!** Only ONE hotkey is currently functional.

### How Backtick Works:

1. Press **\`** (backtick key)
2. Voice Panel opens in sidebar
3. Recording starts automatically (desktop app)
4. Speak your prompt
5. Press **\`** again to stop
6. Transcription appears in Voice Panel input field
7. Edit if needed, press Enter to use

**Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ Desktop app must be running (check system tray)
- ‚úÖ OpenAI API key configured in settings
- ‚úÖ Microphone permissions enabled

### Hotkeys NOT Working:

| Hotkey | Status | Reason |
|--------|--------|--------|
| F13 | ‚ùå Removed | Key doesn't exist on modern keyboards |
| Shift+\` | ‚ùå Not implemented | Work in progress |
| Ctrl+\` | ‚ùå Not bound | Future feature |

## üìã Sprint System - THE OPERATIONAL STRUCTURE

### What is ACTIVE_SPRINT.toml?

Your sprint management file. Location: `sprints/ACTIVE_SPRINT.toml`

### CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: The "prompt" Field

**Every task MUST include a `prompt` field with complete implementation context.**

**Why this matters:**
- Good prompt = Claude executes task without questions
- Bad prompt = Claude gets stuck, asks 10 clarifying questions, wastes time
- **The system FAILS if prompts are vague**

**Good Prompt Example:**
```toml
[tasks.AUTH-001]
id = "AUTH-001"
name = "Implement OAuth2 login"
prompt = """
Implement OAuth2 authentication for the login page using Passport.js.

Context:
- Backend: Express.js 4.18
- Frontend: React 18 with Context API
- Database: PostgreSQL with existing users table
- Files to modify: src/routes/auth.js, src/components/Login.jsx

Requirements:
1. Add OAuth2 provider configuration (Google + GitHub)
2. Create /auth/google/callback and /auth/github/callback routes
3. Store tokens in httpOnly cookies (secure, sameSite: strict)
4. Add middleware: requireAuth() to protect /api/* routes
5. Update Login.jsx with OAuth buttons

Success criteria:
- Users can login with Google/GitHub
- Tokens refresh automatically before expiration
- Protected routes redirect to /login
- All auth flows have tests (happy path + error cases)

Tech stack:
- passport v0.6.0
- passport-google-oauth20 v2.0.0
- passport-github2 v0.1.12
- express-session v1.17.3
"""
status = "pending"
priority = "high"
estimated_hours = 4.0
dependencies = []
```

**Bad Prompt Example (DO NOT DO THIS):**
```toml
prompt = "Add authentication"  # ‚Üê TOO VAGUE, SYSTEM FAILS
```

### Task Format Reference

```toml
[tasks.TASK-ID]
id = "TASK-ID"                # Unique identifier
name = "Short description"     # One-line summary
prompt = """                   # ‚Üê REQUIRED: Full implementation context
Detailed instructions here.

Context: [Tech stack, files, requirements]
Steps: [1, 2, 3...]
Success criteria: [What done looks like]
"""
status = "pending"             # pending, in_progress, completed, blocked
priority = "high"              # high, medium, low
estimated_hours = 2.0          # Time estimate
dependencies = []              # Other task IDs this depends on
```

### Task Execution Workflow

**1. Claude reads Sprint Tab**
- Sees ACTIVE_SPRINT.toml tasks
- Reads task `prompt` field for full context

**2. Claude executes task**
- Uses prompt for implementation details
- Doesn't need to ask clarifying questions (prompt has everything)
- Updates task status: `status = "in_progress"`

**3. Task completes**
- Claude marks: `status = "completed"`
- Adds completion_date automatically
- Moves to next task in dependencies

**ENFORCEMENT RULE:** If Claude asks clarifying questions that are already in the prompt, the prompt failed. Fix the prompt.

2. **OpenAI API key configured**
   - VS Code Settings ‚Üí "aetherlight.openai.apiKey"
   - Get key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Extension syncs key to desktop app automatically

### Using Voice Capture:

1. Press **\`** (backtick)
2. Voice Panel opens in sidebar
3. Recording starts (mic indicator shows)
4. Speak your prompt clearly
5. Press **\`** again to stop
6. Wait for transcription (~2-5 seconds)
7. Transcription appears in input field
8. Edit if needed, press Enter to use

### Troubleshooting Voice:

**Problem:** "Desktop app not connected" error

**Solutions:**
1. Check system tray - is desktop app running?
2. Restart desktop app from Start menu/Applications
3. Check firewall - allow ws://localhost:43215
4. Reinstall desktop app if connection fails

**Problem:** "OpenAI API key required" error

**Solutions:**
1. Open Settings (Ctrl+,)
2. Search "aetherlight.openai.apiKey"
3. Paste your OpenAI API key
4. Restart VS Code to sync to desktop app

**Problem:** Recording starts but no transcription

**Solutions:**
1. Check microphone permissions (System Settings ‚Üí Privacy)
2. Verify OpenAI API key is valid (test at platform.openai.com)
3. Check desktop app logs for errors
4. Ensure internet connection (Whisper API requires network)

## üêõ Known Issues

### Issue 1: Record Button in Webview Doesn't Work

**Problem:** Clicking üé§ in webview shows "mic access denied"
**Workaround:** Use \` hotkey instead (requires desktop app)
**Root Cause:** VS Code webviews block microphone via Permissions-Policy
**Permanent Fix:** Desktop app provides native mic access via IPC

### Issue 2: Voice Panel Not Rendering

**Problem:** Panel opens but content doesn't show
**Status:** Under investigation
**Workaround:** Reload VS Code window (Ctrl+R)

### Issue 3: Sprint Tab Empty

**Problem:** No tasks showing
**Solution:** Create `sprints/ACTIVE_SPRINT.toml` with at least one task (with `prompt` field!)

### Issue 4: Desktop App Won't Connect

**Problem:** "Desktop app not connected" error persists
**Solution:**
- Check desktop app is running (system tray)
- Verify port 43215 not blocked by firewall
- Restart both VS Code and desktop app
- Check desktop app logs for errors

## üí° Usage Examples

### Example 1: Plan a Feature

```toml
# sprints/ACTIVE_SPRINT.toml
[tasks.FEAT-001]
id = "FEAT-001"
name = "Design user authentication flow"
prompt = """
Design and document the user authentication flow for our application.

Context:
- Application: E-commerce site with customer accounts

3. Create sequence diagram for:
   - Email/password registration flow
   - Email/password login flow
   - OAuth login flow
   - Password reset flow
4. Document security considerations:
   - Password hashing (bcrypt, salt rounds)
   - Session management (httpOnly cookies, CSRF protection)
   - Token storage (refresh tokens in database)
5. Create docs/architecture/AUTH_DESIGN.md with all diagrams

Success criteria:
- AUTH_DESIGN.md exists with complete documentation
- Database schema defined (with migrations)
- Sequence diagrams for all flows
- Security checklist completed

Deliverables:
- docs/architecture/AUTH_DESIGN.md
- migrations/001_create_auth_tables.sql
- diagrams/auth_flow.png
"""
status = "pending"
priority = "high"
estimated_hours = 3.0
dependencies = []
```

Tell Claude: "Work on FEAT-001" ‚Üí Claude reads prompt, executes with full context

### Example 2: Multi-Task Sprint with Dependencies

```toml
[tasks.API-001]
id = "API-001"
name = "Create API endpoints"
prompt = """..."""
status = "completed"
completed_date = "2025-10-24"

[tasks.API-002]
id = "API-002"
name = "Add authentication middleware"
prompt = """..."""
status = "in_progress"
dependencies = ["API-001"]    # Waits for API-001 to complete

[tasks.API-003]
id = "API-003"
name = "Write API tests"
prompt = """..."""
status = "pending"
dependencies = ["API-002"]    # Waits for API-002 to complete
```

Claude sees dependency chain ‚Üí Works on tasks in correct order

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Showing

- Check VS Code extensions panel
- Look for "√ÜtherLight" in sidebar Activity Bar
- Try reloading window: Cmd+R (Mac) or Ctrl+R (Windows)

### Sprint Tab Empty

- Create `sprints/ACTIVE_SPRINT.toml`
- Add at least one task WITH `prompt` field
- Refresh Sprint Tab (click refresh button)

### Voice Not Working

- Desktop app must be running (check system tray)
- OpenAI API key configured in settings
- Mic permissions enabled (System Settings ‚Üí Privacy)
- Try \` hotkey (not webview Record button)

### Claude Doesn't See Tasks

- Make sure `sprints/ACTIVE_SPRINT.toml` exists
- Check TOML syntax (use TOML validator if needed)
- Open Sprint Tab ‚Üí Claude can read task list

### Claude Asks Too Many Questions

**Problem:** Claude asks questions already answered in task prompt
**Root Cause:** Prompt field is too vague or missing critical context
**Solution:** Improve task prompt with:
- Complete tech stack details
- File paths to modify
- Step-by-step instructions
- Success criteria
- Example code if helpful

**REMEMBER:** Quality of prompts = Quality of execution

## ü§ñ Claude Code Integration - CRITICAL SECTION

**This file is designed to be read by Claude Code!**

### What Claude Should Do When Reading This File

1. **Read ACTIVE_SPRINT.toml**
   - Location: `sprints/ACTIVE_SPRINT.toml`
   - Parse all tasks
   - Note each task's `prompt` field (this is your execution context)

2. **Execute Tasks According to Prompts**
   - Read task `prompt` field completely
   - Use prompt as source of truth for implementation
   - DON'T ask questions already answered in prompt
   - DO ask questions if prompt is unclear or missing critical info

3. **Update Task Status**
   - Mark `status = "in_progress"` when starting
   - Mark `status = "completed"` when done
   - Add `completed_date = "YYYY-MM-DD"` when completing

4. **Follow Dependencies**
   - Check `dependencies = [...]` field
   - Don't start tasks until dependencies completed
   - Work in dependency order

5. **Enforcement Rules**
   - MUST read task `prompt` field before starting
   - MUST NOT execute tasks without prompt field
   - MUST ask user to add prompt if missing
   - MUST follow operational structure in this file

### If Claude Violates These Rules

**The system fails.**

If Claude:
- Skips reading prompts
- Asks questions already in prompt
- Ignores enforcement rules
- Executes tasks without context

Then the system is considered broken and must be fixed.
