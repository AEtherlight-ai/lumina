# Contributing to Ã†therLight

**Thank you for your interest in contributing!**

We're building civilizational infrastructure - a distributed, self-governing neural network that preserves human reasoning and knowledge. We need your help to stabilize and test for our November 2025 beta launch.

---

## Current Status: Pre-Beta Development

**What exists today:**
- VS Code Extension: 78 TypeScript files, 24 commands
- Rust Core: 132 source files, 521 test functions
- Pattern matching system (~1,500 lines of code)
- Domain agents (33KB), Network infrastructure (45KB)
- Sprint/task management system

**What needs work:**
- Integration testing (Rust â†” VS Code extension)
- NAPI bindings stabilization
- Cross-platform testing (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- Performance validation
- Offline mode completion

**See [README.md](./README.md) for detailed status.**

# OR manually install: code --install-extension *.vsix
```

**Troubleshooting:**
- See [vscode-lumina/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./vscode-lumina/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
- Ask in Discord if you get stuck

### 3. Pick a Task

**For Beginners:**
- Test the extension and report issues
- Improve documentation
- Add example use cases
- Write setup guides

**For Experienced Contributors:**

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Standards

1. **Chain of Thought Documentation**
   - Every function/commit must include reasoning
   - Format: DESIGN DECISION, WHY, REASONING CHAIN
   - See example:
     ```rust
     // DESIGN DECISION: Use BTreeMap instead of HashMap
     // WHY: Need deterministic iteration order for pattern matching
     // REASONING CHAIN:
     // 1. Pattern matching requires stable ordering across runs
     // 2. HashMap iteration order is non-deterministic
     // 3. BTreeMap provides sorted keys with O(log n) lookup
     // 4. Performance acceptable (<50ms for 10k patterns)
     // 5. Result: Deterministic matching with acceptable performance
     ```

2. **Test Coverage**
   - Target: >80% code coverage
   - Unit tests for all new functions
   - Integration tests for feature changes
   - Run tests before submitting: `cargo test` (Rust) or `npm test` (TypeScript)

3. **Performance Targets**
   - Pattern matching: <50ms for 10k patterns
   - Startup time: <500ms
   - Voice transcription: <2s for 30s audio
   - Validate with benchmarks: `cargo bench`

4. **Commit Messages**
   - Use Conventional Commits format
   - Examples:
     - `feat(patterns): add legal domain patterns`
     - `fix(napi): resolve binding memory leak`
     - `docs(setup): improve installation guide`
     - `test(matching): add pattern matching benchmarks`

### Pull Request Process

1. **Before Submitting:**
   - Run tests: `cargo test && npm test`
   - Run linters: `cargo clippy` and `npm run lint`
   - Update documentation if needed
   - Add Chain of Thought comments

2. **PR Description:**
   - Explain WHAT changed
   - Explain WHY (the reasoning)
   - Include test results
   - Link to related issues

3. **Review Process:**
   - Maintainers will review within 3-5 days
   - Address feedback promptly
   - Keep PRs focused (one feature/fix per PR)

cargo test
cargo bench  # Run benchmarks

# VS Code extension tests
cd vscode-lumina
npm test

# Manual testing in VS Code

## The Mission

We're building the Library of Alexandria that cannot burn. Distributed, offline-first, survives any catastrophe. This is civilizational infrastructure.

**Archimedes had calculus 1,800 years before Newton. We lost it. Let's make sure humanity never loses knowledge again.**

**Thank you for helping us build humanity's backup.** ðŸš€
