# DESIGN DECISION: Rust CLI binary for accurate Rust parsing
# WHY: TypeScript can't parse Rust natively, need syn crate
#
# REASONING CHAIN:
# 1. syn crate is the standard Rust parser (used by rust-analyzer, rustfmt)
# 2. walkdir for recursive directory traversal
# 3. serde_json for JSON output to TypeScript
# 4. clap for CLI argument parsing
# 5. Result: Fast, accurate Rust parsing with <3s for 30k LOC
