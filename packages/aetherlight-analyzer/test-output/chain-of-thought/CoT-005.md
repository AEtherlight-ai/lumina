**ID:** CoT-005
**Category:** Refactoring
**Impact:** High
**Confidence:** 85.0%

## Chain of Thought

**DESIGN DECISION:** Extract major code blocks into separate functions

**WHY:** Reduce complexity from 45 to below threshold (15)

**REASONING CHAIN:**
1. Current complexity: 45 (threshold: 15)
2. Complexity ratio: 3.0x over threshold
3. Refactoring will improve maintainability and testability
4. Recommendation: Extract major code blocks into separate functions

## Evidence

- Function processUserData at src/services/user.ts:42

---

## Alternatives Considered

- Leave as-is (technical debt accumulates)
- Rewrite entirely (high risk, high cost)
- Extract sub-functions (recommended)

---

## Trade-Offs

- Refactoring time vs. future maintenance cost
- Code clarity vs. execution performance
