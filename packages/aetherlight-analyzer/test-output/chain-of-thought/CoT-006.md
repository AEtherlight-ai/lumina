## Chain of Thought

**DESIGN DECISION:** Extract nested conditionals

**WHY:** Reduce complexity from 25 to below threshold (15)

**REASONING CHAIN:**
1. Current complexity: 25 (threshold: 15)
2. Complexity ratio: 1.7x over threshold
3. Refactoring will improve maintainability and testability
4. Recommendation: Extract nested conditionals

## Evidence

- Function generateReport at src/services/reports.ts:78

## Alternatives Considered

- Leave as-is (technical debt accumulates)
- Rewrite entirely (high risk, high cost)
- Extract sub-functions (recommended)

---

## Trade-Offs

- Refactoring time vs. future maintenance cost
- Code clarity vs. execution performance
