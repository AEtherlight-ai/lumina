# v0.17.1 - Desktop Binary Fix

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Desktop Binary Packaging (Critical Fix)
- **Fixed desktop binaries using outdated v0.1.0 builds from Oct 30**
- Fresh v0.17.1 binaries now include all Sprint 4 features:
  - ✅ Server-proxied transcription (DESKTOP-001)
  - ✅ Token balance display with real-time updates
  - ✅ Pre-flight checks (375 tokens minimum)
  - ✅ Server-driven warning system
  - ✅ License key activation wizard

### Publish Script Improvements
- **Added automated desktop build step (Step 5.5)**
- Desktop app version now syncs automatically with extension version
- Verifies binaries are built correctly before packaging
- Prevents future packaging issues with stale binaries

## 📦 What's Included

- **Extension**: v0.17.1 (VS Code extension)
- **Desktop Binaries**: v0.17.1 (fresh builds with all Sprint 4 features)
  - `Lumina_0.17.1_x64-setup.exe` (Windows NSIS installer)
  - `Lumina_0.17.1_x64_en-US.msi` (Windows MSI installer)

## ⚠️ Why This Update Matters

v0.17.0 users who installed from npm received old desktop binaries (v0.1.0) that were **missing all Sprint 4 monetization features**. This patch ensures:

1. Fresh desktop binaries with correct version
2. All Sprint 4 features properly included
3. Token-based transcription works correctly
4. License key activation functions properly
