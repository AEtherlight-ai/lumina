# Pattern-DOMAIN-008: Deployment Agent Implementation

**CREATED:** 2025-10-12 | **STATUS:** Implemented (P3.5-012) | **PARENT:** Pattern-DOMAIN-001

---

## Design Decision

Deployment domain agent specializing in CI/CD pipelines, release strategies, rollback procedures, and deployment orchestration.

---

## Domain Expertise

**Keywords (24):** ci, cd, pipeline, deploy, release, rollback, canary, blue-green, rolling update, deployment, kubernetes, k8s, docker, container orchestration, helm, kustomize, argocd, flux, gitops, continuous delivery, automated deployment, version control, semantic versioning, changelog

**Seed Patterns (5):**
1. **CI/CD Pipeline** - GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing and deployment
2. **Blue-Green Deployment** - Zero-downtime releases with traffic switching
3. **Canary Release** - Gradual rollout with 5/20/50/100% traffic split
4. **Rollback Strategy** - Automated rollback on health check failures
5. **Container Orchestration** - Kubernetes deployment with resource limits and health probes

## Implementation Highlights

- **Confidence scoring:** 24 keywords, base 0.7 + 5% per keyword
- **Test coverage:** 19 tests (100%), validates all 5 seed patterns
- **Performance:** match_house <40ms, calculate_confidence <2ms
- **Collaborates with:** InfrastructureAgent (cloud deployment), QualityAgent (automated testing)
