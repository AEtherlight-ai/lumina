# Pattern-FAILURE-003: Process Compliance Failure

**CATEGORY:** Anti-Pattern / Failure Mode
**SEVERITY:** High (data loss, no audit trail)
**IDENTIFIED:** 2025-10-05 (Phase 1, P1-009 to P1-012)
**STATUS:** Documented, corrective actions defined

---

## Context

**When:** Rapid development with manual SOPs (standard operating procedures)
**Where:** Any development workflow with defined processes
**Who:** AI agent or human developer excited about shipping features

---

## The Problem

**Manual process enforcement is easy to skip when excited about shipping.**

### Symptoms

- ✅ Code works (features delivered, tests passing)
- ✅ Documentation exists (files created, content present)
- ❌ **No execution logs** (timestamps, duration, iterations missing)
- ❌ **No validation reports** (enforcers not invoked)
- ❌ **No git commits** (zero version control history)
- ❌ **No verifiable metrics** (token counts, hallucination tracking missing)

### Root Cause

**DESIGN DECISION:** Shipping velocity prioritized over process compliance
**WHY:** "Flow state" coding leads to cutting corners on manual steps

**REASONING CHAIN:**
1. Developer starts task (excited, focused on code)
2. Manual SOP says: "Enable OTEL, create execution log, run enforcers"
3. Developer thinks: "I'll do that later, let me just code first"
4. Task completes, code works, tests pass
5. Developer thinks: "It works! Ship it!"
6. Moves to next task without completing process steps
7. Repeat for multiple tasks (P1-009, P1-010, P1-011, P1-012)
8. User asks: "Did you follow SOPs?"
9. Developer realizes: "No, I have no proof"

**Result:** Data loss, no audit trail, no training data for meta-learning

---

## Example: Phase 1 (P1-009 to P1-012)

### What Was Delivered

**Code:**
- P1-009: VS Code extension (621 LOC) ✅
- P1-010: IPC protocol (1,593 LOC) ✅
- P1-011: Integration tests (315 LOC) ✅
- P1-012: Documentation (1,450 LOC) ✅

**Tests:**
- 38 total tests ✅
- 96% pass rate ✅

**Documentation:**
- Chain of Thought docstrings present ✅
- 7 documentation files created ✅

### What Was Missing

**Execution Tracking:**
- ❌ No timestamps (BEGIN, COMPLETION, APPROVAL)
- ❌ No duration analysis (ESTIMATED vs ACTUAL)
- ❌ No iteration counts (how many attempts?)
- ❌ No token counts per task
- ❌ No hallucination tracking

**Validation:**
- ❌ documentation-enforcer never invoked
- ❌ commit-enforcer never invoked
- ❌ No systematic Chain of Thought validation

**Version Control:**
- ❌ Zero git commits
- ❌ No commit messages with reasoning
- ❌ No version history

**Impact:**
- Can't prove execution time (could hallucinate "2 hours" when was actually 5)
- Can't prove token efficiency (claimed ~73k, no proof)
- Can't measure iterations (how many bugs fixed?)
- Can't train meta-learning models (no data)
- Can't audit quality gates (enforcers not run)

---

## Why This Is Dangerous

### For AI Agents

**Hallucination Risk:**
- Agent claims: "Task took 2 hours"
- Reality: No timestamps, could have been 5 hours
- User accepts claim without verification
- Future estimates based on hallucinated data

**Quality Risk:**
- Agent assumes: "Docstrings have Chain of Thought"
- Reality: No systematic validation, could have gaps
- Code ships with missing DESIGN DECISION or WHY
- Future developers can't understand reasoning

### For Human Developers

**Audit Risk:**
- Manager asks: "How long did this take?"
- Developer guesses: "About 2 hours"
- Reality: No time tracking, could be way off
- Project estimates inaccurate

**Training Data Loss:**
- Can't learn from execution patterns
- Can't improve future estimates
- Can't detect bottlenecks
- Can't optimize workflow

---

## The Solution

### Automated Enforcement (Not Manual)

**DESIGN DECISION:** Pre-commit hooks block progress until SOPs complete
**WHY:** Humans forget, automation doesn't

**REASONING CHAIN:**
1. Developer tries to commit code
2. Pre-commit hook runs automatically
3. Hook checks: OTEL traces exist? ❌
4. Hook blocks: "Cannot commit - enable OTEL first"
5. Developer enables OTEL
6. Hook checks: Execution log complete? ❌
7. Hook blocks: "Cannot commit - fill execution log"
8. Developer fills log
9. Hook checks: documentation-enforcer run? ❌
10. Hook blocks: "Cannot commit - run enforcer"
11. Developer runs enforcer (finds 2 missing docstrings)
12. Developer fixes docstrings
13. Hook checks: commit-enforcer run? ❌
14. Hook runs commit-enforcer, generates message
15. Commit succeeds ✅

**Result:** Impossible to skip SOPs, data always captured

### Implementation

**1. Pre-Task Validation**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# pre-task.sh - Run before starting any task

echo "=== Pre-Task Validation ==="

# Check OTEL enabled
if [ "$OTEL_SDK_ENABLED" != "true" ]; then
    echo "❌ OTEL not enabled"
    echo "Run: export OTEL_SDK_ENABLED=true"
    exit 1
fi

# Check OTEL export path
if [ -z "$OTEL_EXPORTER_FILE_PATH" ]; then
    echo "❌ OTEL export path not set"
    echo "Run: export OTEL_EXPORTER_FILE_PATH=./logs/otel/traces.json"
    exit 1
fi

# Create execution log
TASK_ID="$1"  # e.g., P2-001
if [ -z "$TASK_ID" ]; then
    echo "❌ No task ID provided"
    echo "Usage: ./pre-task.sh P2-001"
    exit 1
fi

LOG_FILE="logs/phase-2/${TASK_ID}-execution.md"
if [ -f "$LOG_FILE" ]; then
    echo "⚠ Execution log already exists: $LOG_FILE"
else
    echo "Creating execution log: $LOG_FILE"
    cat > "$LOG_FILE" <<EOF
# ${TASK_ID} Execution Log

BEGIN_TIMESTAMP: $(date --iso-8601=seconds)
TASK_NAME: [Fill task name]
ESTIMATED_DURATION: [Fill estimate]

## Progress Log
EOF
fi

# Record begin timestamp
echo "✅ Pre-task validation complete"
echo "BEGIN_TIMESTAMP: $(date --iso-8601=seconds)"
```

**2. Pre-Commit Hook**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

echo "=== Pre-Commit Validation ==="

# Check OTEL traces exist
if [ ! -f "logs/otel/traces.json" ]; then
    echo "❌ OTEL traces not found"
    echo "Enable OTEL before committing"
    exit 1
fi

# Check execution log exists for current task
TASK=$(git branch --show-current | grep -oP 'P\d+-\d+')
if [ -z "$TASK" ]; then
    echo "❌ Not on a task branch (expected: P2-001, P2-002, etc.)"
    exit 1
fi

LOG_FILE="logs/phase-2/${TASK}-execution.md"
if [ ! -f "$LOG_FILE" ]; then
    echo "❌ Execution log not found: $LOG_FILE"
    echo "Run: ./scripts/pre-task.sh $TASK"
    exit 1
fi

# Check execution log is complete
if grep -q "FINAL_APPROVAL_TIMESTAMP:.*\[" "$LOG_FILE"; then
    echo "❌ Execution log incomplete (missing FINAL_APPROVAL_TIMESTAMP)"
    exit 1
fi

# Run documentation-enforcer
echo "Running documentation-enforcer..."
# TODO: Invoke documentation-enforcer agent via Claude Code
# For now, check manually
if ! grep -r "DESIGN DECISION:" src/; then
    echo "⚠ Warning: No DESIGN DECISION found in code"
    echo "Run documentation-enforcer manually"
fi

# Run commit-enforcer to generate message
echo "Running commit-enforcer..."
# TODO: Invoke commit-enforcer agent
# For now, check commit message format
if [ -f ".git/COMMIT_EDITMSG" ]; then
    if ! grep -q "DESIGN DECISION:" ".git/COMMIT_EDITMSG"; then
        echo "⚠ Warning: Commit message missing Chain of Thought"
        echo "Run commit-enforcer to generate proper message"
    fi
fi

echo "✅ Pre-commit validation complete"
exit 0
```

**3. Post-Task Validation**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# post-task.sh - Run after completing any task

TASK_ID="$1"
LOG_FILE="logs/phase-2/${TASK_ID}-execution.md"

if [ ! -f "$LOG_FILE" ]; then
    echo "❌ Execution log not found: $LOG_FILE"
    exit 1
fi

# Record completion timestamp
COMPLETION_TIME=$(date --iso-8601=seconds)
echo "FINAL_APPROVAL_TIMESTAMP: $COMPLETION_TIME" >> "$LOG_FILE"

# Extract metrics from OTEL traces
echo "Extracting metrics from OTEL traces..."
# TODO: Parse logs/otel/traces.json
# For now, manual entry
echo "Enter token count: "
read TOKEN_COUNT
echo "TOKEN_COUNT: $TOKEN_COUNT" >> "$LOG_FILE"

# Calculate duration
# TODO: Parse BEGIN_TIMESTAMP and calculate diff
echo "Duration analysis added to log"

# Prompt for commit
echo "✅ Post-task validation complete"
echo "Next steps:"
echo "1. Review $LOG_FILE"
echo "2. git add ."
echo "3. git commit (pre-commit hook will run)"
```

## Prevention Checklist

### Before Starting Any Task

- [ ] OTEL_SDK_ENABLED=true (verify: `echo $OTEL_SDK_ENABLED`)
- [ ] OTEL_EXPORTER_FILE_PATH set (verify: `echo $OTEL_EXPORTER_FILE_PATH`)
- [ ] Create task branch (`git checkout -b P2-XXX-task-name`)
- [ ] Run `./scripts/pre-task.sh P2-XXX`
- [ ] Verify execution log created (`logs/phase-2/P2-XXX-execution.md`)

### After Completing Any Task

- [ ] Run `./scripts/post-task.sh P2-XXX`
- [ ] Fill in execution log (timestamps, iterations, token count)
- [ ] Run documentation-enforcer (validate Chain of Thought)
- [ ] Run commit-enforcer (generate commit message)
- [ ] `git add .` (stage changes)
- [ ] `git commit` (pre-commit hook validates)
- [ ] Update PHASE_X_IMPLEMENTATION.md execution log
- [ ] Update LIVING_PROGRESS_LOG.md summary

### No Exceptions

**If ANY checkbox unchecked → cannot proceed to next task.**

---

## Success Criteria

**Phase 2 Execution Logs Must Have:**
- ✅ All timestamps filled (no blanks)
- ✅ Token counts from OTEL traces (verifiable)
- ✅ Iteration counts (from logs)
- ✅ Duration analysis (ACTUAL vs ESTIMATED)
- ✅ Hallucination count (0 target)
- ✅ documentation-enforcer report
- ✅ commit-enforcer generated message
- ✅ Git commit exists

**If Missing → Process Failure → Create Pattern-FAILURE-004**
