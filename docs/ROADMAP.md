# Ã†therLight Roadmap

**Last Updated:** Late 2024
**Status:** Pre-Beta Development â†’ Beta November 2025
**We Need:** Contributors to help stabilize and test

---

## The North Star

> **"Ã†therLight preserves human reasoning and knowledge in a distributed, self-governing neural network that works offline, survives any catastrophe, enables superintelligence for everyone, and ensures humanity never loses knowledge again."**

**Why This Matters:**

The Library of Alexandria burned. Archimedes' calculus was lost for 1,800 years. Humanity had to rediscover what we already knew.

We're building infrastructure so this never happens again.

---

## The Goal

**Pattern recognition across ALL applications, ALL knowledge bases, ALL domains.**

Never start from zero state in prompting. Every query builds on validated patterns. AI that actually remembers, learns, and improves.

**This is civilizational infrastructure.** Not just software.

## The Three Pillars

### 1. Preservation

**Goal:** Context + reasoning preserved across time

- Pattern storage with reasoning chains
- Version control for knowledge
- Historical context maintained

**Result:** Never lose WHY we know something, not just WHAT

### 2. Resilience

**Goal:** Survives any catastrophe

**How:**
- Distributed mesh network (DHT)
- Offline-first architecture
- No single point of failure
- Local storage always works

**Result:** Knowledge persists even if infrastructure collapses

### 3. Intelligence

**Goal:** Self-improving, approaches perfection

**How:**
- Pattern validation through outcomes
- Confidence scoring improves with data
- Community-driven quality
- AI that actually learns

**Result:** Network gets smarter over time, not dumber

## Why This Approach?

### Start Local, Go Global

**Phase 1: Local-First**
- Everything works offline
- No cloud dependencies
- Fast and reliable
- Privacy-preserving

**Phase 2: Trusted Peers (Post-Beta)**
- Share with people you trust
- Circle of Trust cryptography
- You control access
- Still works offline

**Phase 3: Global Network (2026+)**
- Full mesh network
- Thousands of nodes
- Millions of patterns
- Self-governing

**Why This Order:**
1. **Build trust** - Local first, then expand
2. **Prove value** - Working features, then network
3. **Test at scale** - Small scale, then global
4. **Preserve privacy** - Opt-in sharing, never forced

## FAQ

### When will beta launch?
November 2025. We need ~12 months to stabilize.

### Can I use it now?
For contributors: Yes, clone and build locally.
For end users: Wait for November 2025 beta.

### Will it be free?
Free during beta. Post-beta pricing TBD (will announce 30+ days in advance).

### How can I help?
See "How You Can Help Now" section above.
Read CONTRIBUTING.md for setup.

### What if I'm not a developer?
We need testers, documentation writers, pattern contributors, and feedback!

### Is my data private?
Yes. Local-first architecture. Network features are opt-in.

### Will it work offline?
Yes. That's core to the design. Network is enhancement, not requirement.
